# 📘 Introduction

This project presents a complete Finite Element Analysis (FEA) of a pentagon-shaped 3D structure using **ANSYS Workbench**. Both **static** and **transient** structural simulations were performed to evaluate the mechanical behavior of the model under different loading conditions.

The study uses a material with the following properties:

- **Young’s Modulus:** 96 × 10³ MPa  
- **Poisson’s Ratio:** 0.28  

A **static remote force of 2035 N** was applied at one-third of the fixed face, while the transient simulation subjected the structure to a **281.72 N time-dependent load** applied on non-imprinted conic faces using a **0.2-second timestep**.

A mesh refinement and convergence study was performed to ensure numerical stability and accuracy for both analyses. The results include:

- Stress distribution  
- Total deformation  
- Time-dependent structural response  
- Mesh convergence plots  

This repository contains the complete workflow, including:

- Geometry creation  
- Material definition  
- Boundary conditions  
- Mesh convergence study  
- Static simulation results  
- Transient simulation results  
- Supporting images and documentation  

The goal of this project is to demonstrate a clear, well-documented FEA workflow suitable for academic, research, and engineering reference.
